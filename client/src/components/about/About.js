            <p className='secondP'> When Hatomi first started out, his passion for trade and providing the best equipment for his fellow merchants drove him to  do intense research, quit her day job, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the north America, Japan, Europe, and Arabia and are thrilled to be a part of the fair trade wing of the watches industry. We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
